The physical boundaries of these areas in Glacier National Park and Rogers Pass National Historic Site are neither marked nor maintained in any manner by Parks Canada. It is your responsibility to confirm that you are using the most up-to-date version of the maps. Do not rely solely on these files for navigation as the GPS accuracy of mobile devices may vary. In case of discrepancy, the superintendent’s order on avalanche control prohibitions and restrictions posted in the Revelstoke Parks Canada Administration Building, Rogers Pass Discovery Centre, and at trailheads prevails.

Any use you make of these maps and any reliance on or decisions made based on these maps are your own responsibility absolutely. Parks Canada, its employees and its agents accept no responsibility for damages, if any, suffered by you or any third party as a result of decisions made or actions based on these maps.

<p> WARNING: This map file contains information about seasonal Winter Unrestricted Area, Winter Restricted Area, and Winter Prohibited Area boundaries in Glacier National Park and Rogers Pass National Historic Site. This file was prepared by Parks Canada on 13-09-2024 in light of the information available to it and considered to be true at the time of preparation. </p>

<p> The physical boundaries of these areas in Glacier National Park and Rogers Pass National Historic Site are neither marked nor maintained in any manner by Parks Canada. It is your responsibility to confirm that you are using the most up-to-date version of the maps. Do not rely solely on these files for navigation as the GPS accuracy of mobile devices may vary. In case of discrepancy, the superintendent’s order on avalanche control prohibitions and restrictions posted in the Revelstoke Parks Canada Administration Building, Rogers Pass Discovery Centre, and at trailheads prevails. </p>

<p> Any use you make of these maps and any reliance on or decisions made based on these maps are your own responsibility absolutely. Parks Canada, its employees and its agents accept no responsibility for damages, if any, suffered by you or any third party as a result of decisions made or actions based on these maps.

En cas de divergence, l’ordonnance du directeur du parc concernant les interdictions et les restrictions relatives au déclenchement préventif des avalanches, affichée dans le Centre administratif de Parcs Canada à Revelstoke, au Centre de la découverte du Col-Rogers et aux points de départ des sentiers, prévaut. </p>

<p> The physical boundaries of these areas in Glacier National Park and Rogers Pass National Historic Site are neither marked nor maintained in any manner by Parks Canada. It is your responsibility to confirm that you are using the most up-to-date version of the maps. Do not rely solely on these files for navigation as the GPS accuracy of mobile devices may vary. In case of discrepancy, the superintendent’s order on avalanche control prohibitions and restrictions posted in the Revelstoke Parks Canada Administration Building, Rogers Pass Discovery Centre, and at trailheads prevails. </p>

<p> Any use you make of these maps and any reliance on or decisions made based on these maps are your own responsibility absolutely. Parks Canada, its employees and its agents accept no responsibility for damages, if any, suffered by you or any third party as a result of decisions made or actions based on these maps.

WARNING: This map file contains information about seasonal Winter Unrestricted Area, Winter Restricted Area, and Winter Prohibited Area boundaries in Glacier National Park and Rogers Pass National Historic Site. This file was prepared by Parks Canada on 13-09-2024 in light of the information available to it and considered to be true at the time of preparation.

The physical boundaries of these areas in Glacier National Park and Rogers Pass National Historic Site are neither marked nor maintained in any manner by Parks Canada. It is your responsibility to confirm that you are using the most up-to-date version of the maps. Do not rely solely on these files for navigation as the GPS accuracy of mobile devices may vary. In case of discrepancy, the superintendent’s order on avalanche control prohibitions and restrictions posted in the Revelstoke Parks Canada Administration Building, Rogers Pass Discovery Centre, and at trailheads prevails.

Any use you make of these maps and any reliance on or decisions made based on these maps are your own responsibility absolutely. Parks Canada, its employees and its agents accept no responsibility for damages, if any, suffered by you or any third party as a result of decisions made or actions based on these maps. For greater certainty, under no circumstances whatsoever will Parks Canada, its employees, or its agents be held liable for any loss or damage that may occur to you and any person or persons or property by reason of your or their reliance upon these maps.
				
AVERTISSEMENT: Ce fichier de cartes contient des renseignements sur les limites saisonnières des zones d’accès hivernal non restreint, restreint et interdit dans le parc national des Glaciers et le lieu historique national du Col-Rogers.

Ne vous fiez pas uniquement à ces fichiers pour la navigation, car la précision des GPS sur les appareils mobiles peut varier. En cas de divergence, l’ordonnance du directeur du parc concernant les interdictions et les restrictions relatives au déclenchement préventif des avalanches, affichée dans le Centre administratif de Parcs Canada à Revelstoke, au Centre de la découverte du Col-Rogers et aux points de départ des sentiers, prévaut. 

L’utilisation de ces cartes ou le fait de vous fier à ces cartes ou de fonder une décision sur ces dernières relèvent exclusivement de votre responsabilité. Parcs Canada, ses employés et ses agents déclinent toute responsabilité pour d’éventuels dommages que vous ou une tierce partie pourriez subir à la suite de décisions ou d’actions fondées sur ces cartes. Par souci d’exactitude, Parcs Canada, ses employés ou ses agents ne pourront en aucun cas être tenus responsables de pertes ou de dommages que vous pourriez subir en vous fiant à ces cartes ou que pourraient subir d’autres personnes ou des biens en se fiant à ces cartes.</SimpleData>

In case of discrepancy, the superintendent’s order on avalanche control prohibitions and restrictions posted in the Revelstoke Parks Canada Administration Building, Rogers Pass Discovery Centre, and at trailheads prevails. </p>
